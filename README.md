To help with the navigation in our project, we have separated the different aspects of it into folders. Our process book, proposal, and feedback lie within the main folder HwangSongYeh. Our css for the homepage is included in the marked "css" folder, while the main functionality of our website has a main.css file outside in the general folder area. Our data is included in the marked "data" folder. Our actual pages are within the main folder, supplemented by javascript and d3 within the "js" folder. In the "js2" folder lie some of the libraries we used to help us with our project. A big part of our project was the intensive data scraping to create all of our visualizations, and therefore the python code (using selenium and beautiful soup) was included in our "Data Scraping Process" folder.

Our interface should be intuitive. You select a team and see the team summary where you can continue to select an individual player which will lead you to a player page. You can then compare the selected player with any other player in the NBA and see how they compare. Our example as given compares the two MVP candidates James Harden and Stephen Curry to see how they fared when they faced off against one another in a purely statistical sense.
